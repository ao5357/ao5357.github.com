```html
<rant>
```

As a big fan of [inflationary language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEuNb0nzyvI), I have a soft spot in my heart for
words like 'ponthreen', where the 'too' sound in pontoon gets bumped up to a three, on account of rising prices, of course.

If you Google/Bing/Duck for ponthreen, though, there's very little aside from a mention or three in reddit comments. I consider
this a travesty and injustice and all sorts of mean, nasty things, not because ponthreen is a fun word to say (though it
is!), but because a subset of pontoon boat enthusiasts and especially retailers will call a pontoon boat with three pontoons
a 'tritoon'.

_Clearly this cannot stand_.

## Pontoons are the tube-y bits

A "pontoon boat" is a boat made with one or more pontoons, which can interchangeably be called pontoons, floats, or tubes.
Obviously, despite the fun rhyme, you can't call it a "float boat" because any boat that doesn't float isn't a very good
boat (please don't `@` me about submarines technically being boats or something). I'd assume there's a good linguistic/marketing
reason that "tube boat" lost out to "pontoon boat", but here's where we are. An illustration of a stereotypical pontoon
boat:

{% include atoms/image.html
  src="1200x630/pontoon-boat.jpg"
  alt="A pontoon boat, with text overlaying to show two pontoons with a boat deck on top"
  classes="box-shadow--lifted-edges"
%}

If each tube/float is itself a pontoon, and ['pon-' is not a Latin or Greek numeral prefix in the singular or any other number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix),
then you can't chop up the word to end up with junk like:

  1. unitoon or monotoon
  2. dutoon or ditoon (which would be a standard pontoon boat as we envision them)
  3. tritoon
  4. quadritoon or tetratoon
  5. quinquetoon or pentatoon
  6. sexatoon or hexatoon

...and so on.

A "pontoon boat" is a pontoon boat, **regardless of the number of pontoons** that support its deck(s). This 'tritoon' usage
clearly must be stopped.

It might be palatable, since single-pontoon boats are exceedingly rare to my knowledge, to call a pontoon boat with two
pontoons a "pontoon boat" without qualification, and then boats with more pontoons could be prefixed (with or without a
hyphen) like so:

  * tri-pontoon boat
  * "quad-pontoon boat" or "four-pontoon boat"
  * ...or something like that

But **tritoon is just wrong. Wrong wrong wrong**.

## If you can't beat 'em, join 'em

Since both tritoon and ponthreen are equally wrong for describing a pontoon boat with three floats, and tritoon is already
more commonly-used than ponthreen, I believe the only recourse is to now **spread the word, literally**, and get people
calling them ponthreens.

_(Also, not nearly enough people include an opening rant tag)_

P.S. In an alternate universe, "tube boat" became common usage, and it didn't take long for the 'b' sounds to _compmanteau_
(a portmanteau of 'compound' and 'portmanteau') themselves into 'tuboat'. Some silly midwestern boat dealer would then,
in an insult to alternate-universe Brad, call a tuboat with three tubes a triboat. You can see this unfold in the cutscenes
of _Everything Everywhere All at Once_.
