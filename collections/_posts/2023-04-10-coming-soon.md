Things have been busy!

So busy, in fact, that despite re-platforming this site to use [finished-starter](https://github.com/lowerbarriers/finished-starter)
in 2020, I haven't truly posted anything new since 2014. This post isn't exactly a means of catching up on the last 9 years,
but is a commitment to post far more frequently.

The next post, likely in the next 2 weeks, will assuredly be an overview of my business's website once launched, with a
call to action: to help me get the word out about our affordable Drupal 10 websites. For now, though, if you somehow still
have this feed in your reader, first: thank you! I guess this is hello.

Hi! Talk to you soon.

Btw, I've added [an About page](/about/). It's pretty barebones for the time being, but I'd love to know what you'd like
to see there. Hit me up at [ao5357@gmail.com](mailto:ao5357@gmail.com) with suggestions.
